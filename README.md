This project fetches asteroid approach data from NASA’s public API, stores it in MySQL, and explores insights using SQL + Streamlit.
It provides 15 analytical queries (fastest asteroids, hazardous visits, closest approaches, etc.) and a filter panel to explore data by date, velocity, size, and distance.
Built with Python, Pandas, MySQL, and Streamlit.
